            <h2>what is it</h2>
            <p>kelseywilliams.net is a lightweight api designed to transfer a small json string of data, date, a flag, and an id across the web with a simple request to <code>https://kelseywilliams.net/api/handler.php</code>.  This api is perfect for small projects that don't want to extend beyond their local network, but still want to get some data to another network.  </p>
            <h2>how to use</h2>
            <h3>api key specifics</h3>
            <p>all requests should be made to <code>https://kelseywilliams.net/api/handler.php</code><br><br>api key has a standard rate limit of 1 request every 1000 miliseconds or 1 request every second.  exceeding this number of requests will result in a status code of 429 Too Many Requests.  as of right now, api keys are set to expire after 7 days allowing for a theoretical maximum of 604,800 requests.</p>
            <h3>request: GET </h3>
            <p>request must contain a key titled "key" with a value of the client's api key<br><br>returns JSON string and response code 200 Ok or a response code of 400 Bad Request if the key used is invalid<br><br>example: <code>https://kelseywilliams.net/api/handler.php?key=some_api_key</code></p>
            <h3>request: POST</h3>
            <p>request must contain a message body with the keys "key", "data", "date", "flag" and "id" with values of the client's api key and four strings with a maximum character count of 16,777,215, 255, 255, and 16,777,215, 255 respectively.<br><br>returns a response code of 201 Created or a response code of 200 Ok if the resource was not properly created or a response code of 400 Bad Request if the key used is invalid. </p>
            <h3>request: PUT</h3>
            <p>request must contain a message body with the keys "key", "data", "date", "flag" and "id" with values of the client's api key and four strings with a maximum character count of 16,777,215, 255, 255, and 16,777,215, 255 respectively.<br><br>returns a response code of 201 Created or a response code of 204 No Content if no resource was created.</p>
            <h2>tutorial</h2>
            <p>first: enter an email above to recieve a key.<br><br>second: construct an http request.  <br>read below for a more detailed explanation on what an http request is.<Br>there are many ways to construct an http request but the one i had in mind when starting this project was python's requests libray.  so we'll be using that.  import requests with <code>import requests</code>. lets create a get request.  create a new get request with your api key as the value for a key named "key" (a little confusing i know) like so: <code>r = requests.get("https://kelseywilliams.net/api/handler.php?key=you_api_key_here")</code>.  now run <code>r.status_code</code> if your api key was put in correctly, you should see the number 200.  a 400 means you entered your key wrong or its expired.  404 means you entered the rest of the url incorrectly. once your status code returns 200, run <code>r.json()</code> you should get something that looks like "{}".  that means you have no data on the server under that key.  to enter some data we'll need to perform a post request.</p>
            <h2>what is an http request</h2>
            <p>an http request is a method of communicating, that is, sending and recieving information from the server using the hyper text tranfer protocol.  there are 5 http verbs understood and supported by the kelseywilliams.net api in order to provide crud (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality.  they are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.  </p>
